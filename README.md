# HOUSING PRICE PREDICTION

This project aims to predict housing prices using multiple variables such as square footage, number of bathrooms, number of bedrooms, and waterfront area. The model is built using multilinear regression and is trained on historical housing data to make accurate predictions.

# INSTALLATION

To run this project, you will need to have Python 3 and the following libraries installed: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.

# USAGE

The project includes a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to use the model to make predictions. The notebook includes code to load the data, train the model, and make predictions. Additionally, the documentation includes a detailed explanation of the model's architecture and the different parameters used.

# DATA

The data used in this project was obtained from kaggle. The dataset includes information about housing prices, square footage, number of bathrooms, number of bedrooms, and waterfront area for a variety of properties.

# MODEL

The model is built using multilinear regression and is trained on the historical housing data. The model takes the following variables as input:
Square footage
Number of bathrooms
Number of bedrooms
Waterfront area
Predicts the housing price.

# EVALUATION

The model was evaluated using mean squared error and R^2 score, and it was able to achieve an R^2 score of 0.87 and a mean squared error of 0.02.

# ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
We would like to acknowledge MORINGA for providing the data used in this project and  King County gis opendata for the map data.

# EXAMPLE
In this example, the model takes the input of sqft, no of bathrooms, no of bedrooms and waterfront area and predicts the housing price.

# Conclusion

The model was able to accurately predict the sale price of a property based on the discussed variables.
The results of this analysis can be used to inform real estate pricing and investment decisions.
This report has presented the data used for a housing sale price prediction project using a multilinear regression model.
However, this model and analysis has some limitations such as the data used, which is a snapshot of the housing market at a certain point in time, and it does not account for dynamic and other factors that can affect the housing market such as economic, demographic and political factors.

# RECOMMENDATION

Square footage is the best predictor of a house's price in King County and homeowners who are interested in selling their homes at a higher price should focus on expanding it. When expanding square footage, homeowners should consider building additional bathrooms and bedrooms, as this analysis suggests that number of bathrooms and bedrooms is highly positively related to price.
